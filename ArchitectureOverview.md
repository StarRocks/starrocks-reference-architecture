### What is Architecture Overview

The Architecture diagram can help system designers and developers visualize the high-level, overall structure of their system or application to ensure the system meets their users' needs. You can also use architecture diagrams to describe patterns that are used throughout the design. It's somewhat like a blueprint that can be used as a guide for the convenience of discussing, improving, and following among your team. https://www.edrawsoft.com/architecture-diagram.html
